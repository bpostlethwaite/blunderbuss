serviceStack
============

ServiceStack is a [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) like middleware system for stacking together services that pass data via event emitters. This is accomplished with [Substack's DNode](https://github.com/substack/dnode) project to pass data between services and client. An API must be adhered to by the services if they are to plug into serviceStack.
