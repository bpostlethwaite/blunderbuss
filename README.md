blunderbuss
============

Blunderbuss is a [Connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) like middleware system for stacking together distributed services that pass data via event emitters. This is accomplished with [Substack's DNode](https://github.com/substack/dnode) project to pass data between services and client. Event emitters pass data between the client facing service API's within Blunderbuss. Easy start and finish functions allow for pre and post logic as well as creating circular service chains for repetitive or additive tasks.
